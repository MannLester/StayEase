# StayEase

Every time you choose to apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

## Project Context
StayEase is a website that lists dormitories for students so that they don't need to manually search through Facebook pages.
- StayEase mainly operate in Batangas City, Philippines
- StayEase is a fun project being developed by Mann, Jett, and Clarenz.
- StayEase is similar to big tech products like AirBnB, but it's more focused on students.
- All listed dormitories are verified by the developers.

## Tech Stack
- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Firebase
- TypeScript

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/form-wizard)
- Favor named exports for components and utilities
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., VisaForm.tsx)
- Use camelCase for utility files (e.g., formValidator.ts)

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const objects with 'as const' assertion
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Define strict types for message passing between different parts of the extension
- Use absolute imports for all files @/...
- Avoid try/catch blocks unless there's good reason to translate or handle error in that abstraction
- Use explicit return types for all functions

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state when needed
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals
- Use declarative JSX
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for message types

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully

## Testing
- Write unit tests for utilities and components
- Test across different Chrome versions
- Test memory usage and performance

## Security
- Implement Content Security Policy
- Sanitize user inputs
- Handle sensitive data properly
- Implement proper CORS handling

## Git Usage
Commit Message Prefixes:
- "fix:" for bug fixes
- "feat:" for new features
- "perf:" for performance improvements
- "docs:" for documentation changes
- "style:" for formatting changes
- "refactor:" for code refactoring
- "test:" for adding missing tests
- "chore:" for maintenance tasks

Rules:
- Use lowercase for commit messages
- Keep the summary line concise
- Include description for non-obvious changes
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Documentation
- Maintain clear README with setup instructions
- Document API interactions and data flows
- Keep manifest.json well-documented
- Don't include comments unless it's for complex logic
- Document permission requirements

## Development Workflow
- Use proper version control
- Implement proper code review process
- Test in multiple environments
- Follow semantic versioning for releases
- Maintain changelog
